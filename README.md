This is the first project from the Odin Project's Fundamentals course

In this project I will be demonstrating basic HTML proficiency by creating a simple website
which displays recipies.

I did not include the folder img, which contains three stock pictures from the internet as I didnt feel these add anything. Please recreate this folder to run this project.
